# Simple Python Sudoku Solver Script

## Description
This is a simple sudoku solver script written in Python. It takes a sudoku and uses a Python dictionary to track all possible values for each square on the grid. It then goes through iteratively, eliminating values on "dependent squares" based on values given in the sudoku. The final output is currently in the form of a Python dictionary with the keys being the coordinates for each square and the values being the value in the sudoku.

This is currently WIP.
